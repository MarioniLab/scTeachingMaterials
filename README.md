# Teaching materials for single-cell RNA-seq data analysis

This repository contains some standard teaching materials for scRNA-seq data analysis practicals.
It currently relies on packages from Bioconductor version 3.6.

- `basic/` uses read count data with ERCC spike-ins from the Fluidigm system.
This covers the basic concepts of scRNA-seq data analysis and takes approximately 2 hours to complete.
- `droplet/` uses the PBMC dataset from 10X Genomics.
This describes the analysis of droplet-based scRNA-seq data and takes approximately 1 hour to complete.

Obviously, timings are dependent on the number of questions from the audience, and should be treated appropriately.
